Hello everyone. I have recently just began the process of self teaching in the tech world. Learning programming and focusing along the lines of security.
I am hoping to utlize this site to help with any projects I attempt to create or work on and get feedback for programming and any other helpful advice
that anyone would like to offer. I know I have a long road ahead and look forward to the challenges that await.
